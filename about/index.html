      <h1>About Teh Jigz UP!</h1>
      <p>Teh Jigz Up! is a collaborate project between Daniel Lynds (@) and Kin Lane (@kinlane). We were looking for ways we could work together when it comes to storytelling and helping folks understand the world of technology around them.</p>
      <p>It is a simple comic book format that is driven from a Google Sheet, publishe to Github using Github Pages, and what we are calling a Graffick Git. It is meant to be a storytelling format that anyone can fork and turn into their own comic strip.</p>
      <p>The objective is to help people understand how to use Google Sheets as a data store, accessible via the API. As well as using Github and Github pages for data project management, and the free publishing of simple web sites and tools.</p>
      <p>Teh Jigz Up! is a work in progress, and we are building it for a handful of workshops at conferences, and are looking to keep alive online. This is meant to be the Jig, where our main site can be found at <a href="https://teh-jigz-up.github.io/teh-jigz-up/">Teh Jigz Up!</a></p>
