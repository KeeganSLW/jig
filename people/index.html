    <p>These are some images of people we have assembed for you to use. They are editable in the _data/people.yaml file for this project.</p>
    {% for people in site.data.people %}
      <img src="/images/people/{{ people }}" width="100" style="display: inline" />

    <p>These images come from the <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">Noun Project</a> and <a href="https://www.iconfinder.com/search/?q=people&price=free">Icon Finder</a>. You can manage your own gallery of people once you fork, by editing, and adding to the _data/people.yaml file in your repo.</p>
